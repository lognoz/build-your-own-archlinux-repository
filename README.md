# Lognoz, An Unofficial Repository for Arch Linux
This mirror has been generated by [this project](https://github.com/unix-development/build-your-own-archlinux-repository), an easy-to-use program that provides functionalities to build a custom repository for Arch Linux. Travis-ci is used as a continuous integration service to automatically check if a new version of software has been released, build packages and deploy them into a server.

### To use Pacman, you need to add this configuration to your /etc/pacman.conf

```
[lognoz]
SigLevel = Optional TrustedOnly
Server = https://mirror.lognoz.org
```
